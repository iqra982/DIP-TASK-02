# DIP-Task-2
Task 02
A Python program uses OpenCV, NumPy, and Matplotlib to process a color image. It displays the RGB image, extracts the red, green, and blue channels, converts the image to grayscale, and applies thresholding to create a binary image. Connected component analysis is then used to detect and count objects, and the binary and labeled images are finally displayed.
